# Poker
Poker program for Artificial Intelligence in Video Games class at UCLM Spring 2016

I'm currently trying to implement all of the neccessary components of texas hold'em poker in a C++ program.
Once the main skeleton is in place, I intend on building ontop of this code inside of Unreal Engine.



I'm also using this project as an opprotunity to learn Git since I didn't really use it last semester in my software engineering class.

I'm trying to pick up where I left off with a project I worked on while studying abroad. I wanted to create a poker game with AI players. I want to simulate texas holdem poker games as accurately as possible and use stochastic modeling to make sure the random number generators were normally distributed.

It would really help me out to find a library that already has normally distributed results from game logs, so if anyone knows of good solution using any language, I'm more than open to suggestions.

What I have so far is a C++ Command Line Interface (CLI) Poker Round simulation, minus the betting logic. In the simulation, the user enters how many players to be in the game, as well as the number of rounds to play and the results are printed. It has been a while since I've tested the project, but I'm certain the I had  the ruleset practically debugged. But if these numbers aren't distributed correctly, I may have to redo the hand judging algorithms

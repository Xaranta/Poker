# Poker
Poker program for Artificial Intelligence in Video Games class at UCLM Spring 2016

I'm currently trying to implement all of the neccessary components of texas hold'em poker in a C++ program.
Once the main skeleton is in place, I intend on building ontop of this code inside of Unreal Engine.

I'm also using this project as an opprotunity to learn Git since I didn't really use it last semester in my software engineering class.

<h2> Pablo, a big chunk of the code that you will need for the round function is within the game constructor function. I wrote some psuedocode to let you know where I think the different functions need to go. You're a better programmer than me so I'm sure you'll figure out if there are any holes in my logic.</h2>

# Poker
Poker program for Artificial Intelligence in Video Games class at UCLM Spring 2016

I'm currently trying to implement all of the neccessary components of texas hold'em poker in a C++ program.
Once the main skeleton is in place, I intend on building ontop of this code inside of Unreal Engine.

I'm also using this project as an opprotunity to learn Git since I didn't really use it last semester in my software engineering class.

This is an older version of the code. I ended up deciding it would be faster for me to switch to using vectors instead of linked lists, and a single card ID instead of individual variables for suit and rank. 

We will see if I was right when I get around to finishing the win conditions.

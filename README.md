# Poker
Poker program for Artificial Intelligence in Video Games class at UCLM Spring 2016

I'm currently trying to implement all of the neccessary components of texas hold'em poker in a C++ program.
Once the main skeleton is in place, I intend on building ontop of this code inside of Unreal Engine.

I'm also using this project as an opprotunity to learn Git since I didn't really use it last semester in my software engineering class.
